## Hi, I am passionate about Binary Exploitation & Reverse Engineering.

âš¡ I am currently working as a Software/Hardware Engineer, mainly in the IoT field. Recently, I decided to pursue a career as a Security Engineer, also known as a white hacker, after watching many YouTube videos and conducting market analysis. The world is changing dramatically, especially with millions of IoT devices and platforms becoming valuable targets for attackers, highlighting the need for more robust security measures.

I have finally found what I love to do, and this is my journey towards becoming a White Hacker. This GitHub account is my professional diary documenting how I am honing my skills to contribute to the future of IoT security.
